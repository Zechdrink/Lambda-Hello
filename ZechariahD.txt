Favorite Hobby:
 My favorite hobby is definitely hiking! I love exploring new places and getting out into the wilderness. Also, I like picking up snakes. 
 Hiking is the only thing that enables me to go out and pick up snakes that I normally wouldn't be able to so that is cool. 
 I've picked up over three-hundred rattle snakes to date thanks to hiking. Hiking is great, you should do it to.
