Favorite Hobby in the Twilight Zone:
 My favorite NOT hobby definitely has to be watching sports for fun. Sitting on a couch... Fantastic. 
 Eating food and snacks? Even better... Hanging out with your friends? Fabulous...
 Watching sports while doing all of the aforementioned activities? Pointless.
